## Purpose of this repository

Purpose of creating this repository is for my own gratification and in the process, I will also get some practise on how to write a markdown file.

### Introduction to programming - Types of languages, memory management

There are three types of languages

<ol>
  <li>Procedural</li>
  <li>Functional</li>
  <li>Object Oriented</li>
</ol>

### Procedural
<ul>
  <li>Specifies a series of well structured steps and procedures to compose a program.</li>
  <li>Contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task.</li>
</ul>

### Functional
<ul>
  <li>Writing programs only in pure functions.</li>
  <li>Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on
  the same set of data.</li>
</ul>

### Procedural
<ul>
  <li>Revolves around objects.</li>
  <li>Code + Data = Object</li>
  <li>Was created to make it easier to develop, debug, reuse and maintain</li>
</ul>


## Static vs Dynamic languages

### Static
<ul>
  <li>Perform type checking at compile time.</li>
  <li>Errors will show at compile time</li>
  <li>Declare datatype before you use it</li>
  <li>More control</li>
</ul>

### Dynamic
<ul>
  <li>Perform type checking at runtime.</li>
  <li>Errors will not show till program is run</li>
  <li>No need to declare datatype of variables</li>
  <li>Saves time in writing code but might show errors at runtime</li>
</ul>

## Memory -- Stacks and Heap

Suppose we have ```int a = 10;```, here ```a``` is the reference variable and
```10``` is the object.
```a``` is stored in <b>stack</b> and ```10``` is stored in <b>heap</b>.
